# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-and-EDA
In this project I used three different machine learning models to find the best accuracy for predicting a patient has Breast Cancer or not
We explored some EDA and visualized those findings with plots
I used a tool sweetviz for generating reports for the findings we got from data
